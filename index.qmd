# About Me

Hi, I'm Alec, a data science major at Macalester College. I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on the world.

My particular interests are in biology and healthcare, where I believe data-driven insights can lead to more accurate and effective predictions of RNA structures, and to the identification and elimination of disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.

I'm also a big fan of swimming, playing pool, listening to podcasts, and reading. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to contact me.
