However little thought goes into these creature’s lives. Birds have an impressive journey they seasonally recur. Out of instinct, certain species know where to migrate and how to navigate back home. They use resources like the stars, sun, and earth's magnetism to help them find their way. They also almost always return home to where they were born. Their main purpose of migration is to go from areas of decreasing resources to areas with abundant resources. Birds seek two main resources: food and nesting locations, both equally fundamental to their survival. Over forty percent of the world’s birds migrate, although this is expected to increase due to the deforestation prevalence in tropical regions. In order to prepare for this grueling journey, Birds enter a state called hyperphagia, where they bulk up on food in the preceding weeks to store fat. Their aerodynamics include tailwinds, which blow in the same direction they fly in to help them go faster. Variables like speed, distance, and altitude need to be studied for these species to gain insight on their journeys. Birds play many different roles in the preservation of the environment: predators, prey, pollinators/ seed dispersers. It is imperative that through this research, humans are aided in their efforts to presrve birds’ habitats. \"),\n                        fluidRow(column(7,imageOutput('euro_robin')),\n                                 column(5,imageOutput('white_stork_med'))),\n                        p(\"White storks (Ciconia ciconia) fly south from their summer breeding grounds in Europe starting in August and head for Africa. They spend the winter in savannahs from Kenya and Uganda, however,  some have even been known to make it down to the Cape Province of South Africa. Storks congregate in massive flocks despite their territorial nature. As for dietary preferences, they prefer to forage in meadows where the grasses are short  or in wetlands close to their nests. They eat a variety of foods including insects, worms, reptiles, and amphibians. They also munch on larger animals such as moles, shrews, and fish. European robins (Erithacus rubecula) head south to escape Scandinavian and northern continental Europe’s winter. Similar to the white storks, many migrating robins are faithful to both their summer and winter territories, which may be many thousands of miles apart. Robins reproduce bountifully, often producing between three and five broods a year, each set containing four or five eggs. These broods can overlap, where while the father starts nursing the recently hatched chicks, the mother is already working on the next batch. This enables the population to bounce back readily from any overwinter population losses. Animals that reproduce at such a rate signal overcompensation due to high rates of predation. A robin's lifespan is just 13 months on average due to high mortality within their first year of life. But if they can pass that marker, it increases up to 19 years. As for dietary preferences, Robins eat a wide variety of food including worms, seeds, nuts, suet, invertebrates, and fruit. Lastly, they are notorious for their familiarity with humans and forage for food in household backyards and readily accept seeds left out for them. \"),\n                        div(\n                          style = \n                            \"height: 40px; background-color: #02BE7F; width: 100%; position: absolute; right:0;\",\n                          p(HTML(\"Project &lt;b&gt;by Vanessa Leon and Alec Chen&lt;/b&gt;\"), \n                            style=\"text-align:center;color: white\")\n                        )\n                      )),\n             tabPanel(title = \"Fun Facts\",\n                      h1(\"Rapid Fire Facts!\"),\n                      tags$ol(\n                        tags$li(\"At least 4,000 species of bird are regular migrants, which is about 40 percent of the total number of birds in the world.\"), \n                        tags$li(\"The Arctic tern can fly more than 49,700 miles in a year, making a round trip between their breeding grounds in the Arctic and the Antarctic.And over its lifespan of more than 30 years, the flights can add up to the equivalent of three trips to the moon and back\"),\n                        tags$li(\"Some birds, like the blackpoll warbler, almost double their body weight before flying 2,300 miles non-stop for 86 hours. \n\"),\n                        tags$li(\"The award for fastest bird goes to the great snipe: It flies around 4,200 miles at speeds of up to 60 mph!\"),\n                        tags$li(\"the 1oz northern wheatear travels up to 9,000 miles each way between the Arctic and Africa, giving it one of the largest ranges of any songbird.\")\n                      ),\n                      div(\n                        style = \n                          \"height: 40px; background-color: #02BE7F; width: 100%; position: absolute; right:0;\",\n                        p(HTML(\"Project &lt;b&gt;by Vanessa Leon and Alec Chen&lt;/b&gt;\"), \n                          style=\"text-align:center;color: white\")\n                      )),\n             tabPanel(title = \"Findings\",\n                      h1(\"Findings\"),\n                      p(\"Satellite data is the tool used to gather scans of bird migrations for analysis.

Additionally, seven million die from striking TV and radio towers in North America annually. Not to mention the air pollution that toxifies their paths. We hope this article spreads awareness on these awe-striking creatures, so humans will have more consciousness on their carbon footprint and put an end to so much deforestation.

The use of inheritance established a clear hierarchy among game elements, with Wall inheriting from Rectangle, enabling efficient game logic expansion and maintenance. We leveraged the principle of polymorphism to ensure that objects like Walls and Balls share a common interface for collision detection, facilitating code reuse and adaptability.\n\n\n\ninheritance example\n\n\n\n\n\npolymorphism example"

    "section": "Challenges",
    "text": "Challenges\n\nGetting Tank to Move\nTo achieve smooth tank movement in Tank Trouble, a fundamental challenge was converting XY coordinates to polar coordinates. The tanks’ movement is controlled using directional input or angles. These angles are typically represented in polar coordinates, where the direction and distance from a reference point (the tank’s current position) are used to determine the tank’s new position.\nBy converting XY coordinates to polar coordinates, the game can effectively interpret user input or predefined movement commands. For example, if a player presses a key to move the tank forward, the game can calculate the corresponding polar coordinates (angle and distance) and update the tank’s position accordingly. This conversion simplifies the navigation logic, making it easier to control the tank’s movement and direction within the game’s maze-like environment.\n\n\n\nGetting Tank to Shoot\nAchieving precise and consistent tank shots in Tank Trouble posed a significant challenge due to disparities between the angle input from the tank and the actual angle at which the ball was fired. Initially, shots would often veer off in unexpected directions, leading to frustration for players (and the developers). To rectify this issue, a meticulous process was undertaken to align the ball’s firing angle with the tank’s cannon orientation.\nThis process involved extensive testing and experimentation to determine the correct transformation needed to match the tank’s input angle to the ball’s trajectory angle. Spawned lines were used to estimate the ball’s path, enabling developers to fine-tune the transformation process. The breakthrough came in the form of a transformation factor of 1045 * π * (angle given by the tank), which bridged the angle disparity effectively.\n  :::\nAdditionally, adjustments to the distance (r) at which the ball was spawned from the tank’s center were made through trial and error. This comprehensive approach ensured that tank shots in Tank Trouble were not only accurate but also consistent, allowing players to strategize and engage in thrilling tank battles within the maze environment.\n\n\nGetting Wall and Tank Collision\nTo ensure basic game functionality, we had to develop a reliable collision detection system between the tanks and the walls. To address this, we pinpointed critical locations around the tank to cover the tank’s entire surface: the cannon’s tip and the tank’s four corners.\nWe methodically evaluated each point along the line connecting these designated reference points. Whenever one of these points intersected with a wall element, we implemented a mechanism to halt vertical tank movement, effectively putting a stop to forward and backward tank motion."
